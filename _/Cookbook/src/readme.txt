To try out these files.
1. Create a new jme3 project in the jMonkeyEngine SDK, called "Cookbook".
2. The following libraries should be added to the project: jme3, jme3-test-data, jme3-libraries, jme3-libraries-physics-native
3. Copy the contents of this package to the "src" folder of the project.
4. You can now run any examples from within the SDK.

Please note that some of the examples have dependencies.
Several examples in Chapter04 requires "Nightly builds" to be turned on to get the latest code. Look in Chapter 10: Appendix to find out how to do this.
In Chapter01, the latter recipes will produce the changes necessary to make the TestBirds example working.
In general, it's recommended to use the book and code together, especially if the code is confusing on its own.
